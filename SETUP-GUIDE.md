# Setup guide

Publish the app on **GitHub**, keep all records in **your own Google Sheet (Excel)**, protect it with **your user name + password**, and install it on **Android (APK)** and **Windows (installer)**.

```
 Website (GitHub Pages)  ┐
 Android app (APK)       ├──►  Web app URL  ──►  Google Sheet (Excel) + Drive folder + Gmail reminders
 Windows app (installer) ┘     (asks for your user name + password)
```

All three apps are the **same program** and use the **same Google Sheet**, so what you enter on the phone shows on the PC.

**You need:** a Google account (Gmail) and a GitHub account. No server, no credit card, no Google Cloud API key.

> **About “the API”:** you do **not** need an API key. Google Apps Script gives you a **Web app URL** (it ends with `/exec`). That URL *is* the API of this app. It only answers after the correct user name and password, which you store in your own Google account.

Do the steps in this order: **1 → 2 → 3** (Google), then **4 → 5** (GitHub), then **6 → 7** (install).

---

## Step 1 – Create the Excel (Google) sheet

1. Open <https://drive.google.com> (signed in with your Gmail).
2. **New → File upload** → choose `sample/Medicine-Monitor-Template.xlsx` from this project.
   *(Want to see example rows first? Use `Medicine-Monitor-Sample-Data.xlsx` instead; delete the example rows later.)*
3. Right-click the uploaded file → **Open with → Google Sheets**.
4. In the Google Sheet: **File → Save as Google Sheets** (so it is a real Google Sheet, not an Excel file).
5. Rename it, e.g. **Medicine Monitor**. You should see the tabs `READ ME`, `Medicines`, `DoseLog`, `Periods`, `Files`.

> Don't want to upload the file? Create a blank Google Sheet instead – the script in Step 2 creates the tabs by itself.

## Step 2 – Add the back-end script and your login

1. In your Google Sheet: **Extensions → Apps Script**. A new tab opens.
2. Delete the sample code in `Code.gs`. Open `backend/Code.gs` from this project, copy **everything**, paste it. Click **Save** (disk icon).
3. Set the time zone: click the **gear icon (Project Settings)** → tick **Show “appsscript.json” manifest file in editor** → go back to **Editor** → open `appsscript.json` → replace its content with `backend/appsscript.json` → Save.
   *(It sets the time zone to `Asia/Kolkata`. Change it if you live elsewhere – reminders use it.)*
4. **Set your user name and password** (this is the login for the app):
   - Gear icon (**Project Settings**) → scroll down to **Script properties** → **Edit script properties** → **Add script property** twice:

     | Property | Value |
     |---|---|
     | `APP_USER` | your user name, e.g. `harish` |
     | `APP_PASSWORD` | a long password only you know |

   - **Save script properties.**
   - These stay in your Google account. They are **not** in the code, so publishing the code on GitHub does not reveal them.
5. Back in the **Editor**, choose the function **`setup`** in the drop-down at the top → click **Run**.
6. Google asks for permission (**Review permissions**): choose your account. If it says *“Google hasn't verified this app”* → **Advanced → Go to … (unsafe) → Allow**. This is your own script; it needs Sheets (to save), Gmail (to send your reminders), Drive (to store report files) and triggers (to run reminders).
7. The log says **Execution completed**. You also get a “Medicine Monitor is ready” e-mail. `setup` created the tabs, the Drive folder **Medicine Monitor Reports** and the reminder schedule.
   *(If it ends with an error about `APP_USER`, add the two properties from item 4 and run `setup` again.)*

## Step 3 – Deploy it and copy the Web app URL (“the API”)

1. Top right: **Deploy → New deployment**.
2. Click the **gear icon** next to *Select type* → **Web app**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Description:** `Medicine Monitor`
   - **Execute as:** **Me** (your Gmail)
   - **Who has access:** **Anyone**   ← needed so the website, phone and PC can reach it. The login protects your data.
4. **Deploy** → allow access if asked.
5. Copy the **Web app URL**. It looks like  
   `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycb…long…/exec`
6. Test: paste that URL into a browser tab. You should see: *“Medicine & Period Monitor backend is running.”*

> **Keep the same URL when you change `Code.gs` later:** **Deploy → Manage deployments → ✏ (edit) → Version: New version → Deploy.** (Choosing “New deployment” again gives a different URL.)

## Step 4 – Put the URL in `config.js`

Open `config.js` in this project and paste your URL:

```js
window.MEDMON_CONFIG = {
  WEB_APP_URL: 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycb…/exec'
};
```

This file is safe to publish: the URL alone gives **no** access without your user name and password.

## Step 5 – Publish on GitHub (GitHub Pages)

### 5a. Create the repository
1. Sign in to <https://github.com> → **+ (top right) → New repository**.
2. Name: `medicine-monitor` (any name). **Public**. Tick *Add a README* **off**. **Create repository.**
   *(Public is fine: the repository contains no passwords and none of your records.)*

### 5b. Upload the files — pick ONE way

**Way 1 – in the browser (easiest):**
1. On the new empty repo page click **uploading an existing file**.
2. Drag **everything inside** the project folder into the page: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, `config.js`, `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `README.md`, `SETUP-GUIDE.md`, `.gitignore`, and the folders `icons`, `backend`, `sample`, `installers`, `.github`.
3. **Commit changes.**

> The browser upload sometimes skips hidden folders like `.github`. If `.github/workflows/build-apps.yml` is missing in your repo: **Add file → Create new file**, type `.github/workflows/build-apps.yml` as the name, paste the file's content, **Commit**. (Needed only for Step 7.)

**Way 2 – with Git (PowerShell, inside the project folder):**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Medicine Monitor"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/medicine-monitor.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 5c. Turn on the website
1. Repo → **Settings → Pages**.
2. **Source:** *Deploy from a branch* → **Branch:** `main` / folder `/ (root)` → **Save**.
3. Wait 1–2 minutes. The page shows your address:  
   **`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/medicine-monitor/`**

> Forgot to paste the URL into `config.js` first? On GitHub open `config.js` → pencil icon ✏ → paste the URL → **Commit changes** → wait a minute → refresh the site with **Ctrl+F5**.

## Step 6 – Sign in and install as an app (no APK needed)

1. Open `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/medicine-monitor/` – you see the **sign-in** screen. Enter the `APP_USER` / `APP_PASSWORD` from Step 2.
2. **Android (Chrome):** menu ⋮ → **Install app** (or *Add to Home screen*).
3. **Windows (Edge or Chrome):** click the install icon in the address bar → **Install**.
4. On the first sign-in the app loads your sheet. Add your medicines on the **Medicines** tab.

You stay signed in on a device for 30 days. **Settings → Sign out** removes the records from that device (they stay in your sheet).

## Step 7 – Android APK and Windows installer (built by GitHub)

You do not need Android Studio or anything on your PC; GitHub builds both files for you.

1. Repo → **Actions** tab → (first time) click **“I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them”**.
2. Left side: **Build apps** → **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**.
3. Wait about 10–15 minutes until both jobs show a green ✔. Click the finished run.
4. At the bottom, under **Artifacts**, download:
   - **MedicineMonitor-Android-APK** → contains `MedicineMonitor.apk`
   - **MedicineMonitor-Windows-Installer** → contains `MedicineMonitor-Setup.exe`
   *(Tip: push a tag like `v1.0.0` and the same files also appear under **Releases**.)*

### Install on Android
1. Copy `MedicineMonitor.apk` to the phone (WhatsApp to yourself, Drive, USB …) and tap it.
2. Allow **Install unknown apps** for the app you opened it from. If Play Protect warns about an unknown developer → **Install anyway** (it is your own app).
3. Open **Medicine Monitor** → sign in → **Allow notifications**.
4. For reminders that ring on time even when the app is closed:
   **Settings → Apps → Medicine Monitor → Alarms & reminders → Allow**, and **Battery → Unrestricted**. Then open the app's **Settings** tab → **Turn on pop-up reminders** (it schedules the next 14 days of doses).
5. Updating later: Android only installs a new APK over an old one if both were signed with the same key, and each GitHub build makes a new test key. So **uninstall the old app first**, then install the new one. Your records are safe in the Google Sheet.

### Install on Windows
1. Run `MedicineMonitor-Setup.exe`. Windows SmartScreen says *“Windows protected your PC”* because the installer is not code-signed → **More info → Run anyway**.
2. Choose the folder → **Install**. A desktop shortcut **Medicine Monitor** is created.
3. Closing the window keeps the app in the **system tray** so reminders still pop up. Right-click the tray icon for **Start with Windows** or **Quit**.

## Daily use and managing everything

| I want to… | Do this |
|---|---|
| See my data in Excel | Open the Google Sheet → **File → Download → Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)** |
| Report as Excel / PDF | App → **Reports** → *Download Excel (CSV)* or *Print / Save PDF* |
| Change my password | Apps Script → Project Settings → Script properties → edit `APP_PASSWORD`, then run **`signOutEverywhere`** (signs out all phones / PCs) |
| Lost my phone | Same as above: change `APP_PASSWORD`, run `signOutEverywhere` |
| Wrong password too often (blocked) | Wait 15 minutes, or run **`unlockLogin`** in Apps Script |
| Get reminder mails in a different Gmail | In `Code.gs` set `NOTIFY_EMAIL = 'name@gmail.com'` → Deploy → Manage deployments → New version |
| Put the app link in the reminder mails | In `Code.gs` set `APP_URL` to your GitHub Pages address → new version |
| Update the app | Change files on GitHub → website updates in ~1 minute. Run **Build apps** again for new APK / installer. |

## If something goes wrong

| Message | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| *Unexpected reply – deploy the web app with access “Anyone”* | Deployment access is not **Anyone**, or the URL is wrong. Redo Step 3. |
| *Cannot reach Google (offline, or wrong URL)* | No internet, or `WEB_APP_URL` in `config.js` is wrong. |
| *Login is not set up yet …* | Add `APP_USER` and `APP_PASSWORD` (Step 2, item 4). |
| *Wrong user name or password* | User name is not case-sensitive; the password is. |
| *Too many wrong attempts* | Wait 15 minutes or run `unlockLogin`. |
| *Your session ended* | Sign in again (sessions last 30 days). |
| Website shows an old version | Press **Ctrl+F5**. If you installed it as an app, close and reopen it once. |
| I changed `Code.gs` but nothing changed | You must publish **a new version** of the deployment (Step 3 tip). |
| No reminder e-mails | Run `setup` again (it recreates the schedule) and check Apps Script → **Triggers** (clock icon). |
| The build failed in Actions | Open the failed run, copy the red error lines and send them to me – first runs sometimes need a small fix. |

## Security – what is and is not protected

- **Protected:** your records. They sit in your Google Sheet and are only returned after a correct sign-in (checked in Google's server, not in the web page). Wrong guesses are slowed down and blocked after 5 tries.
- **Public on purpose:** the app's code, `config.js` and the Web app URL. They contain no secrets.
- **Never** put your password into any file you upload to GitHub. It belongs only in *Script properties*.
- Keep the Google Sheet and the Drive folder **private** (not shared with anyone).
- Use a long password. Anyone who knows it can read your records.
